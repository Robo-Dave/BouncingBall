BouncingBall
============

A simple iOS app, written to learn the Swift language.

BouncingBall displays a simple SpriteKit object that reacts to device movement.  It has a
button to add more balls, and an info pane that lets the user adjust the parameters of the
physics model.

More features will be added as time and interest permit.
